# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Educational Excellence
Content must be accessible to beginners with clear explanations, simple English, and step-by-step instructions. All concepts must be broken down into digestible segments with visual examples to enhance learning.

### II. Technical Accuracy
All code examples must be correct, runnable, and verified. Technical content must accurately represent ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, and related technologies with tested implementations.

### III. Comprehensive Coverage
The textbook must comprehensively cover all specified technologies: Physical AI concepts, ROS 2 basics, Gazebo simulation, Unity visualization, NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS, Vision-Language-Action systems, Humanoid robot kinematics, and conversational robotics using GPT models.

### IV. Practical Application
Focus on real-world applications and hands-on examples. Each concept must include practical use cases that demonstrate how students can apply the knowledge to build intelligent robots.

### V. Innovation Focus
Emphasize cutting-edge technologies in the robotics space, particularly Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems and conversational robotics, preparing students for advanced AI robotics laboratories.

### VI. Quality Assurance
All content must be original with rigorous verification. Explanations must match beginner to intermediate level, ensuring accessibility while maintaining technical depth.

## Additional Constraints
- All content must be original and properly attributed where necessary
- Code examples must be tested and verified to be correct and runnable
- Explanations must target beginner to intermediate level audiences
- Technology stack includes Docusaurus for book publishing, with potential RAG functionality using FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and Qdrant
- Optional features may include user signup, personalization, and Urdu translation

## Development Workflow
- Content creation follows a structured writing approach using Spec-Kit Plus
- Textbook sections must include step-by-step explanations with visual examples
- Regular peer reviews focusing on educational effectiveness and technical accuracy
- Integration testing for all code examples and technical demonstrations
- Publishing workflow for GitHub Pages deployment

## Governance
This constitution governs all aspects of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook development. All content and feature additions must comply with the stated principles. Amendments to this constitution require documentation of the change, approval from project maintainers, and a plan for migrating existing content to align with new requirements.

All content contributions must verify compliance with educational excellence and technical accuracy standards. Complexity must be justified with clear pedagogical benefits.
