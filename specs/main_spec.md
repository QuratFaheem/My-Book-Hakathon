# Main Specification: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

## Project Overview

The Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook is a comprehensive educational resource designed to bridge the gap between theoretical AI concepts and practical robotics applications. This project leverages Docusaurus to create an accessible, well-structured online textbook that guides learners from foundational concepts to advanced implementations in physical AI systems.

### Mission Statement

To create an inclusive, comprehensive, and practically-oriented educational resource that enables students, engineers, and researchers to understand, develop, and deploy intelligent physical systems capable of interacting with the real world.

### Target Audience

1. **Students**: Undergraduate and graduate students studying robotics, AI, computer science, or mechanical engineering
2. **Engineers**: Professionals looking to transition into robotics or enhance their skills in physical AI
3. **Researchers**: Academics interested in physical AI applications and novel research directions
4. **Hobbyists**: Tech enthusiasts with programming experience who want to build intelligent robots

### Learning Objectives
