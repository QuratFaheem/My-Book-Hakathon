# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive guide to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. This textbook provides a step-by-step journey into the fascinating world of intelligent physical systems that interact with the real world through sensors, actuators, and sophisticated control algorithms.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI represents the intersection of artificial intelligence and robotics, where AI algorithms are applied to embodied systems that can perceive, reason, and act in the physical world. Unlike traditional AI systems that operate purely in digital domains, Physical AI systems must contend with the complexities, uncertainties, and dynamics of the real world.

## Overview of Topics Covered

This textbook is designed to take you from fundamental concepts to advanced implementations:

1. **Physical AI Concepts**: Understanding the foundations of AI systems that interact with the physical world
2. **ROS 2 Basics**: Learning the Robot Operating System framework for building robotic applications
3. **Gazebo Simulation**: Mastering simulation environments for testing and developing robotic systems
4. **Unity Visualization**: Using Unity for advanced 3D visualization and interaction
5. **NVIDIA Isaac Platform**: Working with NVIDIA's platform for accelerated robotics development
6. **Vision-Language-Action Systems**: Integrating perception, language, and action for cognitive robots
7. **Humanoid Robot Kinematics**: Understanding the mechanics of humanoid movement and control
8. **Conversational Robotics**: Building robots capable of natural human-robot interaction

## Target Audience

This textbook is designed for:
- Students studying robotics, AI, or computer science
- Engineers looking to transition into robotics
- Researchers interested in physical AI applications
- Hobbyists with programming experience who want to build intelligent robots

## Prerequisites

Before diving into this textbook, you should have:
- Basic programming knowledge (Python, C++, or similar)
- Understanding of linear algebra and calculus fundamentals
- Familiarity with Linux command line (preferred but not required)
